//  @file        SourceReadSession.swift
//  @description Abstraction for a consistent read view of a source folder during one backup pass.
//               The engine reads from `rootURL` and asks `shouldDefer` whether a file is being
//               actively written (and should wait for a later pass). This indirection lets us swap
//               in a true APFS source-snapshot session later WITHOUT changing the engine.

//  Notes:
//  - M1 ships `CoordinatedSourceSession`: it reads the live source via NSFileCoordinator and defers
//    files modified within a short "quiet window" (weak torn-file protection, but honest).
//  - A future `SnapshotSourceSession` will mount an APFS source snapshot for a frozen, fully
//    consistent view. That requires a privileged helper (mount is root-only), hence deferred to M3.
//    Because the engine only depends on this protocol, adding it is additive — not a rewrite.
